# A sample DB push implementation

The sample is created for pushing messages from MS SQL server onto different SocketPro server with use of SocketPro replication and persistent message queues at database end.

Key features are: (a) absolutely no data loss, (b) transactional/ACID, and (c) cross-platforms with speed, high-throughout and extremely low latency.

The sample can be implemented within any databases supporting plugins by use of Java, C/C++ or .NET. For example, the DB push can be realized within MySQL and Oracle using C/C++.
