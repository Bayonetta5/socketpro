# Performance comparison between SocketPro and MS WCF frameworks

For detailed performance comparison results, see the site http://www.udaparts.com/document/articles/fastsocketpro.htm

As performance comparison results show, SocketPro could be 20 times faster than MS WCF (.NET window communication framework) if SocketPro is running asynchronously with requests batching. We have NEVER seen a case that WCF is faster than SocketPro.
