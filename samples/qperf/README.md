# Persistent message queue performance comparison between SocketPro and RabbitMQ

1.	For detailed performance comparison results, see the site http://www.udaparts.com/document/articles/fastsocketpro.htm

2.	As performance comparison results show, SocketPro could be 50 times faster than RabbitMQ. We have NEVER seen a case that RabbitMQ is faster than our SocketPro.

3.	We have been doing performance comparison between SocketPro and Kafka message queues, our internal results show that SocketPro is still significantly faster than Kafka queue. Further, SocketPro message queue does NOT have Kafka latency issue.
